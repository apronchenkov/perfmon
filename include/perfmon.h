/**
 * Performance monitor library
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   You could use the PERFMON_SCOPE for a scope inside of a function:
 *
 *     {
 *         PERFMON_SCOPE("counter_name");
 *         ... // scope body
 *     }
 *
 *   or the PERFMON_STATEMENT for a statement:
 *
 *     PERFMON_STATEMENT("counter_name") {
 *         ... // statement
 *     }
 *
 *   WARNING! Most probably you would not like to use the PERFMON macros in
 *   recursive scopes. You could, if you understand what you want; but values of
 *   tick counter would be a bit crazy for a human being.
 *
 *   You could get current statistics in the following way:
 *
 *     for (const auto& counter : PERFMON_COUNTERS()) {
 *        std::cout << counter.Name() << ' '
 *                  << counter.Calls() << ' '
 *                  << counter.Seconds() << std::endl;
 *     }
 *
 *   Values of PERFMON_COUNTERS() can be influenced by non-atomicity
 *   of the integer arithmetic. I believe that this problem should be very rare.
 *   You can also call PERFMON_COUNTER() three times in row and use the median.
 *
